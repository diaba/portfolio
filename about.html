                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <p>I always had a passion for the field of STEM(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and I
                        believe that I can do something to make difference in the world. I grew up in a country where
                        Girls were provided with less participation opportunities as compared to their male
                        counterparts. It is more severe in STEM higher education. Along the readblocks, I studied
                        Mathematic and Physics Applied to Computer Science. With a Master’s degree in Computer Science,
                        I worked as an IT assistant first. Then, I taught programing java and web development for a
                        private professional school.

                <div class="col-sm-4">
                    <p>I joined my husband to us in 2011. It took me 2 years to learn English and settle down. I a mom
                        of 2 lovely boys.
                        During the pandemic, I had my moment to clarity and realized that I wouldn’t let anything stop
                        me pursuing my passion in Computer Science, I began to chase that dream that leads me where I am
                        today.
                        I enrolled in as many courses as I could find and built more skill sets in Java, Python, Flask,
                        Django, Vb, English composition, UX design and javascript. But I didn’t stop there.</p>

                    <p>I believe that with a right education and knowledge anyone can reach a full potential and make
                        dream a reality. So, I am in Google UX Design certification training and I participate at
                        Interact java Immerse training. In my free time , I give tutoring session to students in math
                        and computer science, give back to community and keep my mind and body moving. I love drinking
                        tea called ataya. I enjoy learning new thing, growing and finding new opportunities. If you have
